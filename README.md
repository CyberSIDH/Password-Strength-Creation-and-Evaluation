## 🛡️ Password Attack Types – Explained
______________________________________________________________________________________________
| Attack Type           | Description                                                        |        
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brute Force           | Tries all possible combinations. Slow but exhaustive.              |
| Dictionary Attack     | Uses a pre-defined list of common passwords. Faster but limited.   |
| Credential Stuffing   | Leverages leaked usernames & passwords from breaches.              |
| Phishing              | Social engineering to trick users into revealing credentials.      |

Detailed methodologies, tools, targets, and prevention strategies are included in the report.

## 🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

A robust authentication method requiring at least two of the following:

- Something you **know** (password)
- Something you **have** (OTP device, app)
- Something you **are** (biometrics)

**Popular MFA Tools:**
- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- Duo Security
- YubiKey
- Okta
- FIDO2/WebAuthn

MFA implementation best practices and phishing-resistant techniques are also covered.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Password length and complexity significantly increase strength.
- Avoid predictable patterns, common words, and reused credentials.
- MFA drastically improves security posture.
- Real-world attacker methodologies reinforce the importance of proactive defense.

---

## 📎 Conclusion

This task offered hands-on experience with evaluating password strength and understanding how attackers exploit weak credentials. It also emphasized the importance of adopting secure habits and using modern authentication methods like MFA.
